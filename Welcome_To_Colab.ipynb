This suggests that even though `ssc.stop()` was called, the context might not have fully shut down before the next cell attempted to create a new DStream. In an interactive environment, it can be tricky to manage Spark context lifecycles across cells. A robust approach for this interactive scenario is to ensure that a new StreamingContext is created only if one doesn't exist or is stopped, and to define the entire streaming pipeline (DStream creation and operations) within the same cell where the context is managed. This prevents the state issue.

        "Here are some key areas for refinement and optimization:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Spark Streaming Application:**\n",
        "    *   **Data Source:** Replace `textFileStream` with a production-ready streaming source like Apache Kafka, Kinesis, or a custom receiver for true real-time processing.\n",
        "    *   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling for data parsing, type conversions, and potential issues during processing.\n",
        "    *   **State Management:** For more complex analysis (e.g., calculating moving averages, detecting trends over time per patient), consider using Spark Structured Streaming with stateful operations.\n",
        "    *   **Performance Tuning:** Optimize Spark configurations (e.g., memory, cores, parallelism) for the specific cluster environment and data volume.\n",
        "    *   **Windowing:** Implement windowing operations for analyzing data over specific time intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **HBase Integration:**\n",
        "    *   **Connection Management:** Implement efficient and robust HBase connection management within Spark workers (e.g., using connection pooling). The current approach of creating a new connection in `foreachRDD` for each batch is inefficient for production. A `foreachPartition` approach with connections managed per partition is more suitable.\n",
        "    *   **Schema Design:** Review and potentially optimize the HBase schema design based on expected query patterns for historical data and alerts. Consider row key design for efficient retrieval.\n",
        "    *   **Error Handling:** Implement retry mechanisms and error handling for HBase write operations.\n",
        "    *   **Batching:** Ensure efficient batching of puts when writing to HBase, as already partially implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Alerting Mechanism:**\n",
        "    *   **Alert Delivery:** Replace console printing with a real-world alerting system (e.g., sending emails via an SMTP server, sending messages to a messaging queue like Kafka for consumption by an alerting service, integrating with notification platforms like PagerDuty or Slack).\n",
        "    *   **Alert Logic:** Refine the anomaly detection thresholds and logic based on clinical requirements and potentially use more advanced techniques (e.g., machine learning models for anomaly detection).\n",
        "    *   **Alert Severity:** Implement different levels of alerts based on the severity of the abnormal readings.\n",
        "    *   **Debouncing/Thresholding:** Prevent excessive alerts for transient spikes by implementing debouncing or time-based thresholding.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Dashboard:**\n",
        "    *   **Real-time Data Source:** Connect the dashboard to a real-time data source or a low-latency data store updated by the Spark application (e.g., a separate table in HBase optimized for recent data, a time-series database, or a messaging queue).\n",
        "    *   **Historical Data Retrieval:** Implement efficient data retrieval from HBase for historical trends, potentially using filters and scans optimized for the HBase schema.\n",
        "    *   **Visualization:** Enhance visualizations for better insights (e.g., adding threshold lines to plots, displaying multiple vital signs, creating summary statistics).\n",
        "    *   **Interactivity:** Add more interactive features (e.g., time range selection for historical data, filtering by anomaly type).\n",
        "    *   **Deployment:** Plan for deploying the Streamlit application as a web service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the current state in the notebook, we can focus on refining the **Spark processing logic** and the **HBase writing logic** within the `process_rdd` function to be more aligned with production patterns (like using `foreachPartition` for HBase writes) and enhancing the console output for better debugging and monitoring within this environment. We can also refine the dashboard code to better handle both the simulated and potential real HBase data scenarios.\n",
